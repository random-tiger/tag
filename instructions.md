### **Overview**

You're building a web application where users can generate video segments using Google's Veo in sequential order to tell a longer story. 

For example, 

A user should be able to provide and image and / or text to generate a video. Then, when the video is generated, the user can choose to continue by writing a prompt, and the system will use frames from the previous video and it's initial prompt to see the next generation and so on. The platform will then stitch them all together.
